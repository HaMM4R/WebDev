				<p>Queen is the debut studio album by the British rock band Queen, released on 13 July 1973 by EMI Records in the UK and by Elektra Records
				in the US. It was recorded at Trident Studios and De Lane Lea Music Centre, London, with production by Roy Thomas Baker (as Roy Baker), 
				John Anthony and Queen. The album was influenced by the hard rock, progressive rock and heavy metal of the time and covers subjects such 
				as folklore ("My Fairy King") and religion ("Jesus"). Lead singer Freddie Mercury composed five of the ten tracks, guitarist Brian May composed 
				four songs, (including "Doing All Right", which was co-written by then Smile bandmate Tim Staffell), and drummer Roger Taylor composed and sang 
				"Modern Times Rock and Roll". The final song on the album is a short instrumental version of "Seven Seas of Rhye".</p>

				<p>Queen II is the second studio album by the British rock band Queen, released on 8 March 1974 by EMI Records at midnight in the UK and by 
				Elektra Records in the US. It was recorded at Trident Studios and Langham 1 Studios, London from February to August 1973 with co-producers 
				Roy Thomas Baker and Robin Cable, and engineered by Mike Stone. The album is notable for its combination of a heavy rock sound with an art 
				rock sensibility. It has been called "a pillar of grandiose, assaultive hard rock" by the Rock and Roll Hall of Fame.</p>
				<p>Queen II is not a concept album but a collection of songs with a loose theme running throughout. The two sides of the original LP 
				were labelled "Side White" and "Side Black" (instead of the conventional sides "A" and "B"), with corresponding photos of the band dressed in
				white or in black on either side of the record's label face. The white side has songs with a more emotional theme and the black side is almost 
				entirely about fantasy, often with quite dark themes. Mick Rock's album cover photograph was frequently re-used by the band throughout its career,
				including the music videos for the songs "Bohemian Rhapsody" (1975), and "One Vision" (1985).</p>
				<p>Released to an initially mixed critical reception, Queen II remains one of the band's lesser-known albums. Nonetheless, the album has retained 
				a cult following since its release, has garnered praise from other musicians such as Axl Rose, Steve Vai and Billy Corgan, and is significant in 
				being the first album to contain elements of the band's signature sound of multi-layered overdubs, vocal harmonies, and varied musical styles.</p>

				<p>Sheer Heart Attack is the third studio album by the British rock band Queen, released on 8 November 1974 by EMI Records in the United Kingdom
				and by Elektra Records in the United States. Digressing from the progressive themes featured on their first two albums, this album featured more 
				conventional rock tracks and marked a step towards the "classic" Queen sound. It was produced by the band and Roy Thomas Baker and launched 
				Queen to mainstream popularity in the UK and throughout the world.</p>
				<p>The album's first single "Killer Queen" reached number 2 in the British charts and provided them with their first top 20 hit in the U.S., peaking 
				at number 12 on the Billboard singles chart. Sheer Heart Attack was the first Queen album to hit the U.S. top 20, peaking at number 12 in 1975. The 
				album has been acknowledged for containing "a wealth of outstanding hard rock guitar tracks". Retrospectively, it has been listed by multiple
				publications as one of the band's best works and has been deemed an essential glam rock album.</p>

				<p>A Night at the Opera is the fourth studio album by the British rock band Queen, released on 21 November 1975 by EMI Records in the United Kingdom 
				and by Elektra Records in the United States. Produced by Roy Thomas Baker and Queen, it was the most expensive album ever recorded at the time of its
				release. The album takes its name from the Marx Brothers film of the same name, which the band watched one night at the studio complex when recording. 
				A Night at the Opera incorporates a wide range of styles, including ballads, songs in a music hall style, hard rock tracks and progressive rock influences.</p>
				<p>The album topped the UK Albums Chart for four non-consecutive weeks. It peaked at number four on the US Billboard 200 chart and became the band's first
				Platinum-selling album in the US. The worldwide sales for the album are over six million copies. It also produced the band's most successful single in the
				UK, "Bohemian Rhapsody", which became their first UK number one and one of the best-selling singles in both the UK and the world.</p>

				<p>A Day at the Races is the fifth studio album by the British rock band Queen, released on 10 December 1976 by EMI Records in the United Kingdom 
				and by Elektra Records in the United States. It was the band's first completely self-produced album, and the first not to feature producer Roy Thomas Baker.
				Recorded at Sarm East, The Manor and Wessex Studios in England, A Day at the Races was engineered by Mike Stone. The album serves as a companion album to 
				the band's previous album, A Night at the Opera, both taking their names from Marx Brothers films, as well as sharing similar packaging and eclectic musical themes.</p>
				<p>The album peaked at #1 in the UK, Japan and the Netherlands. It reached #5 on the US Billboard 200 and was Queen's fifth album to ship gold in the US, and 
				subsequently reached platinum status in the same country. A Day at the Races was voted the 67th greatest album of all time in a national 2006 BBC poll.</p>

				it went 4x platinum in the United States, and achieved high certifications around the world, selling over 6 million copies.</p>

				<p>Jazz is the seventh studio album by the British rock band Queen. It was released on 10 November 1978 by EMI Records in the United Kingdom and by 
				Elektra Records in the United States. Produced by Roy Thomas Baker, the album artwork was suggested by Roger Taylor, who previously saw a similar 
				design painted on the Berlin Wall. The album's varying musical styles were alternately praised and criticised. It reached #2 in the UK Albums Chart
				and #6 on the US Billboard 200. Jazz has sold over 5 million copies worldwide.</p>

				<p>The Game is the eighth studio album by the British rock band Queen. It was released on 30 June 1980 by EMI Records in the UK and by Elektra Records
				in the US. The Game features a different sound than its predecessor, Jazz (1978). The Game was the first Queen album to use a synthesiser (an Oberheim OB-X). 
				"Crazy Little Thing Called Love", "Sail Away Sweet Sister", "Coming Soon" and "Save Me" were recorded from June to July 1979. The remaining songs were 
				recorded between February and May 1980.</p>
				<p>The Game became the only Queen album to reach No. 1 in the US, and became their best-selling studio album in the US, with four million copies sold to
				date, tying News of the World's US sales tally. It is estimated to have sold 4 million copies worldwide. The album received very favourable reviews. Notable
				songs on the album include the bass-driven "Another One Bites the Dust" and the rockabilly "Crazy Little Thing Called Love", both of which reached No. 1 in 
				the US. Reissued on May 2003 on DVD-Audio with Dolby 5.1 surround sound and DTS 5.1. The 5.1 mix of "Coming Soon" features an alternate backing track, 
				because the final master tapes were not found when mixing the album to 5.1. The photo on the cover of the EMI CD is different from that originally used
				on the LP and cassette release, even though the Hollywood CD still has the original photo. The original photo (with Roger Taylor having folded arms and
				Brian May not having a hand resting upon his exposed hip) is shown in the article. This alternate photo was also used on the cover of the album in the 
				Crown Jewels box set released in 1998, and on the DTS DVD-Audio edition of the album released in 2003. The Game was the first Queen album to be recorded digitally.</p>

				<p>Flash Gordon is the ninth studio album and the first soundtrack album by the British rock band Queen, released on 8 December 1980 in the United 
				Kingdom by EMI Records and in February 1981 in the United States by Elektra Records. It was one of two film soundtracks that they produced along with
				Highlander. It is the soundtrack to the science fiction film Flash Gordon, and features lyrics on only two tracks. "Flash's Theme" was the only single 
				to be released from the album under the title "Flash". The album reached #10 on the UK charts and #23 in the US. The album was reissued worldwide on 
				27 June 2011 (excluding the US and Canada, where it was released on 27 September 2011) as part of the band's 40th anniversary. The reissue adds
				an EP of related tracks.</p>
				<p>Unlike most soundtrack albums, audio from the film is prominently used in the songs.</p>

				<p>Hot Space is the tenth studio album by the British rock band Queen. It was released on 21 May 1982 by EMI Records in the UK and by Elektra 
				Records in the US. Marking a notable shift in direction from their earlier work, they employed many elements of disco, funk, rhythm and blues, 
				dance and pop music on the album. This made the album less popular with fans who preferred the traditional rock style they had come to associate
				with the band. Queen's decision to record a dance-oriented album germinated with the massive success in the US of their 1980 hit "Another One Bites
				the Dust" (and to a lesser extent, the UK success of the song).</p>
				<p>"Under Pressure", Queen's collaboration with David Bowie, was released in 1981 and became the band's second #1 hit in the UK. Though included 
				on Hot Space, the song was a separate project and was recorded ahead of the album, before the controversy over Queen's new disco-influenced rock 
				sound. The album's second single, "Body Language", peaked at #11 on the US charts. In July 2004, Q magazine listed Hot Space as one of the top
				fifteen albums where great rock acts lost the plot. Most of the album was recorded in Munich during the most turbulent period in the band's history, 
				and Brian May and Roger Taylor despised the new sound, with both being very critical of the influence Freddie Mercury's manager Paul Prenter had on the
				singer. Estimated sales of the album currently stand at 3.5 million copies.</p>

				<p>The Works is the eleventh studio album by the British rock band Queen, released on 27 February 1984 by EMI Records in the United Kingdom and by 
				Capitol Records in the United States. After the synth-heavy Hot Space (1982), the album saw the re-emergence of Brian May and Roger Taylor's rock
				sound, while still incorporating the early 80s retro futuristic electronic music (Freddie Mercury) and New York funk scenes (John Deacon). Recorded 
				at the Record Plant Studios in Los Angeles, California and Musicland Studios in Munich, Germany from August 1983 to January 1984, the album's title 
				comes from a comment Taylor made as recording began – "Let's give them the works!" During the decade, after a conservative reaction against and ban 
				of the music video for "I Want to Break Free" in the United States, the band decided not to tour in North America and lost the top spot in U.S. sales,
				but sales around the world (especially Europe) would be even better. The Works has sold over 5 million copies worldwide.</p>

				<p>A Kind of Magic is the twelfth studio album by the British rock band Queen, released on 3 June 1986 by EMI Records in the UK and by Capitol Records 
				in the US. It was their first studio album to be recorded digitally, and is based on the soundtrack to the film Highlander, the first in a series directed 
				by Russell Mulcahy. A Kind of Magic was Queen's first album to be released since they had been acclaimed for their performance at the 1985 Live Aid concert.
				It was an immediate hit in the UK, going straight to number one and selling 100,000 copies in its first week. It remained in the UK charts for 63 weeks,
				selling about six million copies worldwide (600,000 in the UK alone). The album spawned four hit singles: the album's title track "A Kind of Magic", 
				"One Vision", "Friends Will Be Friends", and "Who Wants to Live Forever", which features an orchestra conducted by Michael Kamen, while the last track,
				"Princes of the Universe", is the theme song to Highlander.</p>
				<p>Although Queen would release another two albums with Freddie Mercury (excluding posthumous releases), A Kind of Magic would turn out to be the band's 
				last album promoted with a concert tour, because of Mercury's diagnosis with HIV the following year, which subsequently caused his death in 1991. For the 
				first time in their career, the band allowed themselves to be filmed while they were in the recording studio. The video for "One Vision" shows them in 
				various stages of writing and recording the song.</p>

				<p>The Miracle is the thirteenth studio album by the British rock band Queen, released on 22 May 1989 by Parlophone Records in the United Kingdom and
				by Capitol Records in the United States. The album was recorded as the band recovered from Brian May's marital problems and Freddie Mercury's AIDS diagnosis
				in 1987 (which was known to the band, though not publicised at the time). Recording started in January 1988 and lasted for an entire year. The album was 
				originally going to be called The Invisible Men, but three weeks before the release, according to Roger Taylor, they decided to change the name to 
				The Miracle. It was also the last album to feature a band photo with all four original members on the front cover.</p>
				<p>The album reached #1 in the UK, Austria, Germany, the Netherlands, and Switzerland, and #24 on the US Billboard 200 chart. The Miracle is estimated to 
				have sold 5 million copies, indicating that despite lower sales in the United States, the band had excellent numbers in the world, even without touring. 
				Allmusic would name The Miracle as Queen's best album of the 1980s, along with The Game. It would prove to be the band's penultimate album to be recorded 
				with Freddie Mercury, as he died in November 1991, less than a year after the next album, Innuendo, was released.</p>

				<p>Innuendo is the fourteenth studio album by the British rock band Queen, released on 5 February 1991 by Parlophone in the United Kingdom and by Hollywood 
				Records in the United States. Produced by David Richards and the band, it was the band's final studio album to be released in Freddie Mercury's lifetime 
				and also their last to be composed entirely of new material. It reached the No. 1 spot on the UK album charts and stayed at that position for two weeks, 
				and also peaked at No. 1 in Italy, the Netherlands, Germany, Switzerland, staying at No. 1 for three weeks, four weeks, six weeks, and eight weeks, respectively.
				It was the first Queen album to go Gold in the US upon its release since The Works in 1984.</p>
				<p>The album was recorded between March 1989 and November 1990. In the spring of 1987, Mercury had been diagnosed with AIDS, although he kept his illness a 
				secret from the public and denied numerous media reports that he was seriously ill. The band and producers were aiming for a November or December release date
				in order to catch the crucial Christmas market, but Mercury's declining health meant that the release of the album did not take place until February 1991. 
				Stylistically, Innuendo is in some sense a return to Queen's roots,[3] with its harder rock sound, complex musical composition (title track), psychedelic effects
				("I'm Going Slightly Mad"), and somewhat weakened vocals from Mercury ranging over three octaves (F2-A5). Nine months after the album was released, Mercury 
				died of AIDS-derived bronchial pneumonia.</p>
				<p>The album cover was designed by Queen and Richard Gray. The booklets and single covers from the album are by Grandville, or are inspired by his illustrations. 
				Innuendo was voted the 94th greatest album of all time in a national 2006 BBC poll.</p>

				<p>Made in Heaven is the fifteenth and final studio album by the British rock band Queen, released on 6 November 1995 by Parlophone Records in the United Kingdom
				and by Hollywood Records in the United States. After singer Freddie Mercury's death, guitarist Brian May, drummer Roger Taylor, and bass guitarist John Deacon worked
				with vocal and piano parts that Mercury recorded before his death, adding fresh instrumentation to the recordings. Both stages of recording, before and after Mercury's
				death, were completed at the band's studio in Montreux, Switzerland. The album debuted at number 1 in the UK where it went 5× platinum. The album became a worldwide 
				success, especially in Europe, selling over 5 million copies there, and more than 7.5 million around the world.</p>
